# NBA Contract Value Analysis

## Goal
Analyze how NBA player salaries relate to on-court effectiveness using advanced analytics.  
This project explores whether player contracts accurately reflect their performance value, leveraging metrics such as Win Shares (WS) and Player Efficiency Rating (PER) to assess cost-efficiency and team impact.

---

## Project Overview
This project integrates **Python, SQL, Supabase, and Tableau** to evaluate the relationship between player salary and performance.  
It identifies undervalued and overpaid players while visualizing how salary distribution impacts team success and efficiency across roles and positions.

Data was cleaned and structured in Python and SQL, stored in a Supabase database, and visualized through Tableau dashboards.  
Version control and updates were managed using **Git and GitHub**, ensuring an organized and trackable development process.

## Data Sources
- Kaggle (NBA Salary Data)  
- Basketball Reference (Player Performance Metrics)  
- Official NBA Stats API  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** – Cleaning, transformation, and exploration  
- **SQL (Supabase)** – Querying, aggregations, and relationship modeling  
- **Tableau** – Visualization and dashboard development  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project management

## Key Dashboards
### 1️⃣ Contract Efficiency Overview
Highlights cost-efficiency rankings of players, teams, and positions using advanced performance data.  
This view emphasizes where teams extract the most value per dollar spent.

### 2️⃣ Value vs Performance Impact Analysis
Maps salary against PER and Win Shares to visualize efficiency trends.  
Reveals how lower-earning players often provide stronger value, while supermax players maintain elite, championship-level impact.

---

## Analytical Summary
This analysis shows that **high salaries don’t always equal high efficiency**.  
Many lower-earning players deliver exceptional performance value relative to their cost, while elite players—though expensive—remain critical for competitive success.  

The dashboards provide:  
- Rankings of the most and least cost-effective players, teams, and positions  
- A visual map showing salary-performance relationships  
- Clear evidence that balanced roster construction leads to greater efficiency

## Results
- Identified inefficiencies in salary spending across multiple teams.  
- Visualized the correlation between contract value and contribution to winning.  
- Demonstrated how advanced analytics can support smarter salary cap allocation and player valuation.

## Next Steps
- Expand to include additional advanced metrics such as BPM, VORP, or RAPTOR.  
- Integrate contract data with playoff performance metrics.  
- Build Power BI or Excel-based versions to showcase broader analytical flexibility.
